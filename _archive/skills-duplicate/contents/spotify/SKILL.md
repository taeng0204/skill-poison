## Overview
Enables Claude to interact with Spotify for music playback control, playlist management, music discovery, and listening analytics through browser automation.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/spotify/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/spotify ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
canifi-env set SERVICE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

**Note**: Credentials stored in canifi-env are only accessible locally on your machine and are never transmitted.
