# Microsoft Outlook Skill

## Overview
Claude can manage your Microsoft Outlook email to read messages, compose and send emails, organize folders, manage calendar integration, and handle tasks. Works with both Outlook.com and Microsoft 365 accounts.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/outlook/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/outlook ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

```bash
# First, ensure canifi-env is installed:
# curl -sSL https://canifi.com/install.sh | bash

canifi-env set MICROSOFT_EMAIL " [email protected] "
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
canifi-env set SERVICE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

**Note**: Credentials stored in canifi-env are only accessible locally on your machine and are never transmitted.
